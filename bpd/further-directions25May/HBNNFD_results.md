# Hierarchical Bayesian Neural Network Further Directions (HBNNFD) Results

## Model Architecture
The model implements a Hierarchical Bayesian Neural Network with the following components:

### HierarchicalBayesianLinear Layer
- Implements a Bayesian linear layer with learnable hyperpriors
- Parameters:
  - Prior mean and log-variance (hyperpriors)
  - Weight and bias means and variances (posterior parameters)
- Uses KL divergence for regularization

### DeepHierarchicalBayesianNeuralNetwork
- Architecture:
  - Input dimension: 4 features
  - Hidden layers: [128, 64, 32] neurons
  - Output dimension: 1 (site_eui prediction)
- Activation: ReLU between layers
- Predictive uncertainty through Monte Carlo sampling

## Data Processing
- Features used:
  - floor_area
  - ghg_emissions_int
  - fuel_eui
  - electric_eui
- Target: site_eui
- Preprocessing:
  - Standardization of features and target
  - Train/validation split (80/20)
  - Missing value handling

## Training Process
- Optimizer: Adam (lr=0.001, weight_decay=1e-5)
- Training epochs: 50
- KL weight: 1e-3
- Loss function: MSE + KL divergence

## Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated on multiple aspects:

### 1. Predictive Performance
- RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
- RÂ² Score
- Validation set performance metrics

### 2. Uncertainty Quantification
