## Overview of Results

This document provides an analysis of the Adaptive Elastic Horseshoe (AEH) prior's performance in building energy analysis. The examines model metrics, feature importance, uncertainty quantification, and various visualisations to understand the prior's effectiveness.

## Prior Selection Rationale for Energy Data

The choice of priors in this analysis is specifically tailored to address the unique characteristics of building energy data. Here's why these priors are particularly well-suited:

### 1. Multi-Scale Nature of Energy Data

Building energy data exhibits multiple scales of variation:
- **Temporal Scales**: Daily, weekly, seasonal patterns
- **Spatial Scales**: Building-level, system-level, component-level effects
- **Operational Scales**: Base loads, peak loads, part-load conditions

The hierarchical prior structure addresses this by:
- Global level (τ) capturing overall energy consumption patterns
- Group level handling different types of energy features
- Local level (λ) adapting to specific building characteristics

### 2. Complex Feature Interactions

Energy data often shows intricate relationships between features:
- **Non-linear Dependencies**: Energy consumption vs. building size
- **Cross-feature Effects**: HVAC system efficiency vs. building envelope
- **Time-dependent Interactions**: Weather effects vs. occupancy patterns

The Adaptive Elastic Horseshoe prior handles this through:
- Elastic net component balancing between sparse and dense solutions
- Horseshoe component allowing for heavy-tailed distributions
- Adaptive component learning from data patterns

### 3. Heterogeneous Uncertainty

Energy data typically shows varying levels of uncertainty:
- **Measurement Uncertainty**: Different precision in different systems
- **Modeling Uncertainty**: Varying complexity in different subsystems
- **Operational Uncertainty**: Different reliability in different conditions

The prior structure addresses this by:
- Group-specific uncertainty modeling
- Adaptive shrinkage parameters
- Robust noise modeling

### 4. Feature Group Characteristics
