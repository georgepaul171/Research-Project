## Detailed Interpretation

### Building Energy Performance Insights

#### 1. Floor Area Dominance
The overwhelming importance of floor area features (`floor_area_squared` and `floor_area_log` at ~83% combined importance) reveals several key insights:
- **Non-linear Energy Scaling**: The high importance of squared terms indicates that energy consumption scales non-linearly with building size
- **Economies of Scale**: The logarithmic relationship suggests diminishing returns in energy efficiency as buildings get larger
- **Practical Implications**: 
  - Energy efficiency measures should be scaled differently for different building sizes
  - Large buildings may need more aggressive energy reduction strategies
  - Small buildings might benefit more from basic efficiency improvements

#### 2. Energy Consumption Patterns
The significant role of energy metrics (`ghg_emissions_int_log`, `fuel_eui`, `electric_eui`) indicates:
- **Emissions-Energy Link**: Strong correlation (0.939) between GHG emissions and energy use suggests:
  - Energy efficiency directly impacts environmental performance
  - Carbon reduction strategies should focus on energy optimisation
