   - Suggests significant impact of building age on energy performance

2. **GHG Emissions**
   - Strong correlation with target variable
   - Important predictor of energy performance
   - Log transformation improves predictive power

3. **Energy Star Rating**
   - Negative correlations suggest inverse relationship with energy consumption
   - Normalized rating more important than squared term

4. **Feature Interactions**
   - Age-GHG interaction shows strong positive correlation
   - Age-Energy Star interaction shows strong negative correlation
   - Area-Energy Star interaction shows moderate negative correlation

## Recommendations

1. **Feature Selection**
   - Consider removing low-importance features:
     - `energy_mix`
     - `energy_star_rating_squared`
     - `floor_area_squared`

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Focus on building age transformations
   - Maintain GHG emissions log transformation
   - Consider additional interaction terms

3. **Model Improvements**
   - Address high variance in energy metrics
   - Consider feature scaling for high-variance features
   - Explore non-linear relationships further
