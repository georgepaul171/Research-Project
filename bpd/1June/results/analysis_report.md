# Adaptive Prior ARD Model Analysis Report

## 1. Model Architecture and Theoretical Framework

### 1.1 Bayesian Linear Regression with ARD
The implemented model extends traditional Bayesian linear regression through Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD), incorporating adaptive prior specifications. The model employs a hierarchical Bayesian framework where:

\[
p(y|X,w,\alpha) = \mathcal{N}(y|Xw,\alpha^{-1}I)
\]

with prior distributions:

\[
p(w|\beta) = \mathcal{N}(w|0,\text{diag}(\beta)^{-1})
\]

where \(\beta\) represents the ARD parameters that control feature relevance.

### 1.2 Adaptive Prior Formulation
The model implements three distinct prior types:

1. **Hierarchical Prior**:
   \[
   p(\beta_j|\lambda_j,\tau_j) \propto \frac{1}{\beta_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\lambda_j\tau_j}{2\beta_j}\right)
   \]

2. **Spike-and-Slab Prior**:
   \[
   p(w_j|\pi_j,\sigma^2_{0j},\sigma^2_{1j}) = (1-\pi_j)\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2_{0j}) + \pi_j\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2_{1j})
   \]

3. **Horseshoe Prior**:
   \[
   p(w_j|\lambda_j,\tau) \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + \frac{w_j^2}{\lambda_j^2\tau^2}}}
   \]

### 1.3 Dynamic Shrinkage Mechanism
The model incorporates dynamic shrinkage through:

\[
\kappa_j^{(t+1)} = (1-\eta)\kappa_j^{(t)} + \eta \frac{1}{\beta_j}
\]

where \(\eta\) is the adaptation rate and \(\kappa_j\) represents the shrinkage strength for feature \(j\).

## 2. Implementation Details

### 2.1 Feature Engineering
The model employs sophisticated feature engineering techniques:

1. **Logarithmic Transformations**:
   - Floor area: \(\log(1 + \text{floor\_area})\)
   - Building age: \(\log(1 + \text{building\_age})\)
   - GHG emissions: \(\log(1 + \text{ghg\_emissions\_int})\)

2. **Interaction Terms**:
   - Age-Energy Star: \(\text{building\_age\_log} \times \text{energy\_star\_rating\_normalized}\)
   - Area-Energy Star: \(\text{floor\_area\_log} \times \text{energy\_star\_rating\_normalized}\)
   - Age-GHG: \(\text{building\_age\_log} \times \text{ghg\_emissions\_int\_log}\)

3. **Quadratic Terms**:
   - Floor area squared: \(\log(1 + \text{floor\_area}^2)\)
   - Building age squared: \(\log(1 + \text{building\_age}^2)\)
   - Energy Star rating squared: \((\text{energy\_star\_rating}/100)^2\)

### 2.2 Model Training
The training process employs:

1. **Cross-validation** with 5 folds
2. **EM Algorithm** for parameter estimation
3. **Robust Scaling** for features
4. **Standard Scaling** for target variables

## 3. Results and Interpretation

### 3.1 Model Performance
The model demonstrates exceptional performance:

- **R² Score**: 0.9455
- **RMSE**: 6.2403
- **MAE**: 3.9225
- **Mean Uncertainty**: 0.2080

These metrics indicate that the model explains approximately 94.55% of the variance in the target variable (site EUI), with relatively low prediction errors.

### 3.2 Feature Importance Analysis

#### Top Features by Importance:
1. **floor_area_log** (0.6631 ± 0.0000)
2. **floor_area_squared** (0.1885 ± 0.0000)
3. **building_age_squared** (0.0527 ± 0.0000)
4. **ghg_per_area** (0.0156 ± 0.0000)
5. **energy_intensity_ratio** (0.0148 ± 0.0000)

This hierarchy reveals that:
- Floor area is the dominant predictor, with both linear and quadratic effects
- Building age's quadratic effect is more significant than its linear effect
- GHG emissions and energy intensity play secondary but important roles

### 3.3 Feature Interactions

#### Strongest Interactions:
1. **floor_area_log × floor_area_squared** (6.8452)
2. **building_age_log × building_age_squared** (4.2126)
3. **energy_star_rating_normalized × energy_star_rating_squared** (4.1968)
4. **building_age_log × floor_area_squared** (3.8100)
5. **floor_area_squared × building_age_squared** (3.8040)

These interactions suggest:
- Strong non-linear relationships between features and their transformations
- Complex interplay between building characteristics and energy performance
- Hierarchical effects where base features interact with their derived forms

### 3.4 Feature Correlations with Target

#### Top Correlations:
1. **ghg_emissions_int_log** (0.9389)
2. **age_ghg_interaction** (0.7734)
3. **electric_eui** (0.6983)
4. **fuel_eui** (0.6256)
5. **energy_star_rating_squared** (-0.5779)

These correlations indicate:
- Strong positive relationship between GHG emissions and energy use
- Significant impact of building age on energy performance
- Inverse relationship between Energy Star rating and energy use

### 3.5 Prior Hyperparameters

- **Global Shrinkage**: 0.6673
- **Local Shrinkage**: 1.9065

These values suggest:
- Moderate global regularization
- Strong local feature-specific regularization
- Effective balance between model complexity and generalization
