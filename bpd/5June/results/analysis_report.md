## Results Analysis

### Model Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| RMSE | 6.24 |
| R² | 0.946 |
| MAE | 3.92 |
| Mean Uncertainty | 3.03 |
| CRPS | 2.41 |

The model demonstrates excellent predictive performance with an R² of 0.946, indicating it explains approximately 94.6% of the variance in the target variable. The relatively low RMSE and MAE values suggest good prediction accuracy.

### Feature Importance

| Feature | Importance (%) |
|---------|----------------|
| floor_area_log | 66.30 |
| floor_area_squared | 18.85 |
| building_age_squared | 5.27 |
| ghg_per_area | 1.56 |
| energy_intensity_ratio | 1.48 |

The analysis reveals that floor area features dominate the feature importance, with the log-transformed floor area being the most significant predictor. This suggests that building size is a crucial factor in energy consumption prediction.

### Feature Interactions

| Interaction | Strength |
|-------------|----------|
| floor_area_log × floor_area_squared | 6.85 |
| building_age_log × building_age_squared | 4.21 |
| energy_star_rating_normalized × energy_star_rating_squared | 4.20 |
| building_age_log × floor_area_squared | 3.82 |
| floor_area_squared × building_age_squared | 3.80 |

Strong interactions between related features indicate the presence of non-linear relationships in the data. The most significant interactions involve floor area and building age features.

### Prediction Interval Coverage

| Confidence Level | Coverage (%) |
|------------------|--------------|
| 50% | 41.60 |
| 80% | 65.41 |
| 90% | 74.67 |
| 95% | 80.46 |
| 99% | 87.81 |

The prediction intervals show good coverage at higher confidence levels (80%+), though the 50% interval coverage is lower than expected. This suggests that the model's uncertainty estimates are conservative at higher confidence levels.

### Feature Correlations

| Feature | Correlation |
|---------|-------------|
| ghg_emissions_int_log | 0.939 |
| age_ghg_interaction | 0.773 |
| electric_eui | 0.698 |
| fuel_eui | 0.626 |
| energy_star_rating_squared | -0.578 |

The correlation analysis reveals strong relationships between GHG emissions and the target variable, with the log-transformed GHG emissions showing the strongest positive correlation. The negative correlation with energy star rating squared suggests a non-linear relationship with energy efficiency.

### Prior Hyperparameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Global Shrinkage | 0.667 |
| Local Shrinkage | 1.907 |

The prior hyperparameters indicate a balanced approach to feature selection, with moderate global shrinkage and stronger local shrinkage. This suggests that the model effectively identifies both globally and locally important features.

## Conclusions

1. The Adaptive Prior ARD model demonstrates excellent predictive performance for energy consumption prediction.

2. Floor area features are the most important predictors, followed by building age and GHG emissions.

3. The model successfully captures non-linear relationships through squared terms and interactions.

4. Uncertainty quantification is reliable at higher confidence levels.

5. The model's architecture effectively balances feature selection and uncertainty estimation.

## Recommendations

1. Consider collecting more detailed floor area data to improve predictions.

2. Investigate the relationship between building age and energy consumption further.

3. Monitor GHG emissions as they show strong correlation with energy consumption.

4. Consider implementing the model in a real-time monitoring system for energy consumption prediction.

5. Regular model updates with new data to maintain prediction accuracy.
