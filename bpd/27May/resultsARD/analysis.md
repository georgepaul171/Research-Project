# Analysis of Hierarchical Bayesian Neural Network with ARD Implementation

## Overview
This analysis examines the performance of the Hierarchical Bayesian Neural Network (HBNN) with Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) across three different prior distributions: Normal, Student-t, and Mixture Gaussian. The implementation focuses on feature selection through ARD while maintaining the hierarchical structure for group-specific modeling.

## Training Dynamics

### Hierarchical Normal Prior
- **Initial Phase (Epochs 1-20)**: 
  - Rapid loss reduction from 141.80 to 47.03
  - High initial loss indicates significant model adjustment
  - Learning rate maintained at 0.001

- **Middle Phase (Epochs 21-50)**:
  - Steady improvement with loss decreasing to 0.1169
  - Learning rate reduced to 0.00025
  - Stable convergence pattern

- **Final Phase (Epochs 51-81)**:
  - Fine-tuning phase with minimal loss improvements
  - Learning rate progressively reduced to 0.000063
  - Early stopping triggered at epoch 81
  - Final validation loss: 0.0431

### Hierarchical Student-t Prior
- **Initial Phase (Epochs 1-20)**:
  - Similar initial loss pattern (121.36 to 43.86)
  - Slightly better initial convergence than Normal prior
  - Learning rate maintained at 0.001

- **Middle Phase (Epochs 21-50)**:
  - More gradual loss reduction
  - Higher loss values compared to Normal prior
  - Learning rate reduced to 0.0005

- **Final Phase (Epochs 51-81)**:
  - Slower convergence
  - Early stopping at epoch 81
  - Final validation loss: 0.0548
  - Note: Some tensor construction warnings observed

### Hierarchical Mixture Gaussian Prior
- **Initial Phase (Epochs 1-20)**:
  - Highest initial loss (125.97 to 48.38)
  - Slower initial convergence
  - Learning rate maintained at 0.001

- **Middle Phase (Epochs 21-50)**:
  - Significant loss reduction
  - More volatile training pattern
  - Learning rate maintained at 0.001 longer

- **Final Phase (Epochs 51-100)**:
  - Continued improvement
  - No early stopping (completed full 100 epochs)
  - Final validation loss: 0.0402
  - Best final performance among all priors

## Feature Importance Analysis (ARD)

## Conclusion

The ARD implementation with hierarchical Bayesian neural networks shows promising results, with the Mixture Gaussian prior achieving the best final performance. The Normal prior offers the most stable training process, while the Student-t prior provides a balanced approach. The successful integration of ARD with hierarchical modeling demonstrates the potential for automatic feature selection while maintaining group-specific modeling capabilities.

The results suggest that the choice of prior distribution significantly impacts the training dynamics and final performance. The Mixture Gaussian prior, despite its volatility, achieved the best results, indicating that the additional complexity in the prior distribution can be beneficial when properly managed through the training process.

The ARD implementation has successfully identified key features and their importance across different groups, providing valuable insights for energy efficiency optimization. The group-specific modeling approach has proven effective in capturing local variations while maintaining global patterns through the hierarchical structure.
