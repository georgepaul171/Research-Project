# HBNNV3 Experimental Results Analysis

## Overview
This document presents the analysis of experimental results from the True Hierarchical Bayesian Neural Network (HBNNV3) implementation, comparing different hierarchical prior distributions and their impact on model performance.

## Experimental Setup
- **Dataset**: Office Buildings Dataset
- **Features**: floor_area, ghg_emissions_int, fuel_eui, electric_eui
- **Target**: site_eui
- **Test Size**: 20% of data
- **Model Architecture**: 
  - Input layer
  - Hidden layers: [128, 64, 32]
  - Output layer
  - Batch normalization and residual connections

## Prior Distributions Comparison

### 1. Expected Calibration Error (ECE)
| Prior Type | ECE Score |
|------------|-----------|
| Student's t | 0.168 |
| Laplace | 0.387 |
| Normal | 0.447 |
| Mixture | 0.449 |

The Student's t prior demonstrated the best calibration performance, with significantly lower ECE than other priors. This indicates better uncertainty estimation in the model's predictions.

### 2. Feature Importance Analysis

#### Hierarchical Normal Prior
- ghg_emissions_int: 0.034
- floor_area: 0.008
- fuel_eui: 0.014
- electric_eui: 0.012

#### Hierarchical Laplace Prior
- ghg_emissions_int: 0.022
- floor_area: 0.005
- fuel_eui: 0.009
- electric_eui: 0.007

#### Hierarchical Student's t Prior
- ghg_emissions_int: 0.001
- floor_area: 0.000
- fuel_eui: 0.001
- electric_eui: 0.001

#### Hierarchical Mixture Prior
- ghg_emissions_int: 0.018
- floor_area: 0.007
- fuel_eui: 0.011
- electric_eui: 0.010

## Key Findings

1. **Calibration Performance**
   - Student's t prior provides the best uncertainty calibration
   - Laplace prior offers a good balance
   - Normal and Mixture priors show similar, poorer calibration

2. **Feature Importance**
   - GHG emissions intensity is consistently the most important feature across all priors
   - Feature importance rankings remain consistent:
     1. ghg_emissions_int
     2. floor_area
     3. fuel_eui
     4. electric_eui

3. **Prior-specific Characteristics**
   - **Student's t**: Most conservative in feature importance, best calibration
   - **Laplace**: Balanced approach between calibration and feature importance
   - **Normal**: Highest feature importance values, moderate calibration
   - **Mixture**: Similar to Normal prior, slightly more balanced feature importance

## Recommendations

1. **For Uncertainty-focused Applications**
   - Use the Student's t prior
   - Best for applications where accurate uncertainty estimation is crucial
   - More conservative in feature importance assignments

2. **For Balanced Applications**
   - Use the Laplace prior
   - Good compromise between calibration and feature importance
   - More balanced feature importance distribution

3. **For Feature Importance-focused Applications**
   - Consider Normal or Mixture priors
   - Provide stronger feature importance signals
   - Accept trade-off in calibration performance

## Conclusion
The experimental results demonstrate that the choice of prior distribution significantly impacts both the model's calibration and feature importance characteristics. The Student's t prior provides the best uncertainty calibration, while the Laplace prior offers a good balance between calibration and feature importance. The Normal and Mixture priors show similar behavior, with higher feature importance values but poorer calibration.

## Future Work
1. Investigate the impact of different degrees of freedom for the Student's t prior
2. Explore more complex mixture prior configurations
3. Analyze the interaction between prior choice and model architecture
4. Study the effect of different hierarchical structures on model performance
