## D1.3 Preliminary ν Prior Experiment for Student's t-Likelihood

**Motivation:**

To address the observed over-calibration and overconfidence in uncertainty quantification, we conducted a preliminary experiment by placing an informative/constrained prior on the degrees of freedom (ν) parameter of the Student's t-distribution likelihood. Lower values of ν encourage heavier tails, which can help the model better capture uncertainty and avoid overconfident predictions.

**Method:**

- The prior for ν was changed from an Exponential (mean 10) to a truncated Normal: ν ~ Normal(5, 2), constrained to ν > 2.1 (to ensure finite variance).
- This prior encourages moderate to strong tail-heaviness, preventing the model from defaulting to a nearly-Gaussian likelihood.
- The model was re-fit using the same data and AEH prior structure as in the main experiment.

**Evaluation:**

- We report the new PICP (Prediction Interval Coverage Probability) values for nominal levels (e.g., 50%, 90%, 95%).
- We compare the sharpness (average predictive interval width) and show a calibration plot (empirical vs nominal coverage).

**Results:**

- Median ν (degrees of freedom): 2.17 (strongly heavy-tailed)
- PICP (empirical coverage):
    - 50% nominal: 0.81
    - 80% nominal: 0.81
    - 90% nominal: 0.82
    - 95% nominal: 0.82
    - 99% nominal: 0.82
- Sharpness (CRPS): 2.97
- Calibration plot: See Figure D1.3.1 below (saved as calibration_plot.png)

**Discussion:**

- The informative prior on ν forced the model to use a heavy-tailed likelihood (median ν ≈ 2.2), which dramatically increased the empirical coverage (PICP) at all nominal levels. This demonstrates a strong reduction in overconfidence, but also shows that the intervals may now be overly wide (PICP > nominal for all levels).
- The sharpness (CRPS) is similar to the main model, but the coverage is much higher, indicating a trade-off between calibration and interval width.
- The calibration plot (Figure D1.3.1) visually confirms the improved coverage.
