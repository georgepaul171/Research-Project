## 1. Methodology

### 1.1 Model Specification

The analysis employed a hierarchical Bayesian regression model with the following structure:

**Likelihood:**
```
y_i ~ Normal(μ_i, σ)
```

**Linear Predictor:**
```
μ_i = β₀ + Σᵢ xᵢⱼ βⱼ
```

**Prior Specifications (Simplified):**
- **Intercept:** β₀ ~ Normal(0, 10)
- **Energy Coefficients:** β_energy ~ Normal(0, τ_energy × λ_energy)
- **Building Coefficients:** β_building ~ Normal(0, σ_building)
- **Interaction Coefficients:** β_interaction ~ Normal(0, σ_interaction)
- **Precision Parameters:**
  - τ_energy ~ HalfCauchy(1)  # Global energy coefficient precision
  - λ_energy ~ HalfCauchy(1)  # Local energy coefficient precisions (8 parameters)
  - σ_building ~ HalfNormal(1)  # Building coefficient precision
  - σ_interaction ~ HalfNormal(1)  # Interaction coefficient precision
- **Observation Noise:** σ ~ HalfNormal(1)

**Important:** This is a simplified version of the intended AEH prior. The full AEH prior includes:
- Adaptive elastic net mixing parameter (α)
