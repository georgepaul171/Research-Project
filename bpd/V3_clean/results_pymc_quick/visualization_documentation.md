# PyMC Results: Visualization Documentation

This document describes the visualizations generated by your Bayesian regression analysis using PyMC.

---

## 1. Trace Plots (`trace_plots.png`)
- **Purpose:** Assess convergence and mixing of MCMC chains for key parameters (e.g., intercept, sigma, tau_energy, sigma_building).
- **What to look for:**
  - Chains should overlap and look like 'hairy caterpillars'.
  - No trends or drifts; good mixing.
  - R-hat values close to 1 indicate convergence.

---

## 2. Posterior Predictive Checks (`posterior_predictive_checks.png`)
- **Observed vs. Predicted Scatter:**
  - **Purpose:** Compare model predictions to actual observed values.
  - **Interpretation:** Points should cluster around the y=x line. Large deviations may indicate model misspecification.
- **Residuals vs. Predicted:**
  - **Purpose:** Check for systematic errors in predictions.
  - **Interpretation:** Residuals should be randomly scattered around zero. Patterns may indicate bias.
- **Residuals Histogram:**
  - **Purpose:** Assess the distribution of errors.
  - **Interpretation:** Should be roughly normal and centered at zero.
- **PPC vs. Observed Histogram:**
  - **Purpose:** Compare the distribution of model predictions to observed data.
  - **Interpretation:** Overlap indicates good model fit. Large discrepancies suggest model issues.

## 3. Feature Importance (`feature_importance.png`)
- **Purpose:** Show the posterior mean and standard deviation (uncertainty) for each regression coefficient.
- **Interpretation:**
  - Large magnitude (positive or negative) = more important feature.
  - Wide error bars = more uncertainty in the effect estimate.

## 4. Additional Notes
- **Divergences and Tree Depth Warnings:**
  - If present, these are reported in `sampling_warnings.json`.
  - Divergences may indicate model geometry issues; consider increasing `target_accept` or reparameterizing.
  - Tree depth warnings suggest the sampler is hitting its maximum allowed depth; consider increasing `max_treedepth`.

**For best results:**
- Use trace plots and R-hat/ESS diagnostics to confirm convergence.
- Use posterior predictive checks to validate model fit.
- Use feature importance plots to interpret model drivers.

All plots are saved as PNGs in this results folder.
