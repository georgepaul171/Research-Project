# HMC Diagnostics Analysis

## Overview
This analysis examines the HMC (Hamiltonian Monte Carlo) run results to determine if HMC is actually working and provide insights into the sampling behavior.

## Key Findings

### 1. **HMC is Running Successfully** ✅
- **Evidence**: The `aeh_hyperparams_log.txt` shows active parameter updates across 50 iterations
- **Parameter Evolution**: Clear convergence patterns in lambda, tau, alpha, beta, and momentum values
- **EM Progress**: The `em_progress_log.txt` shows 50 iterations of EM with HMC integration

### 2. **Parameter Convergence Analysis**

#### AEH Hyperparameters Evolution:
- **Lambda values**: Start around 0.32-0.31, converge to 0.79-0.87 (showing feature selection)
- **Tau (global shrinkage)**: Stabilizes around 0.89-0.92 (good convergence)
- **Alpha (elastic net mixing)**: Decreases from 0.51 to 0.14 (increasing L1 regularization)
- **Beta (horseshoe mixing)**: Decreases from 0.91 to 0.13 (reducing horseshoe influence)
- **Momentum**: Shows active dynamics, indicating HMC is exploring the posterior

#### Weight Evolution:
- **Range**: Weights vary between -0.66 and 0.67 across iterations
- **Stability**: Final weights show reasonable magnitudes for feature importance
- **Convergence**: Weights stabilize by iteration 40-50

### 3. **Performance Metrics**
- **R²**: 0.932 (excellent predictive performance)
- **RMSE**: 6.98 (low prediction error)
- **MAE**: 4.73 (good absolute error)
- **Mean Uncertainty**: 24.73 (reasonable uncertainty quantification)

### 4. **Missing HMC Diagnostics** ⚠️

**Critical Missing Files:**
- No `hmc_rhat_ess_iter*.json` files (R-hat and ESS diagnostics)
- No `hmc_acceptance_iter*.json` files (acceptance rate diagnostics)
- No trace plot files (`trace_*.png`)

**Why Missing:**
The enhanced HMC diagnostics from `v3hmc.py` were not generated because:
1. The current run used the original `V3.py` (not `v3hmc.py`)
2. The `_hmc_sampling` method was called with `return_chains=False`
3. Trace plots and detailed HMC diagnostics were not saved

### 5. **What We Can Infer About HMC**

#### Positive Indicators:
- **Active Parameter Updates**: The AEH hyperparameters show meaningful evolution
- **Convergence**: Parameters stabilize over iterations
- **Momentum Dynamics**: Non-zero momentum values indicate HMC exploration
- **Performance**: Strong predictive performance suggests effective sampling

#### Limitations:
- **No Direct HMC Evidence**: We can't see acceptance rates, R-hat values, or ESS
- **No Trace Plots**: Can't visualize mixing or convergence of chains
- **No Chain Diagnostics**: Can't assess if multiple chains are mixing well

### 6. **Recommendations**

#### Immediate Actions:
1. **Run `v3hmc.py`**: Use the enhanced version to get full HMC diagnostics
2. **Generate Trace Plots**: Visualize parameter chains for convergence assessment
3. **Monitor Acceptance Rates**: Ensure HMC is accepting reasonable proportions of proposals
4. **Check R-hat Values**: Verify convergence across multiple chains

#### Enhanced Diagnostics Needed:
- **Acceptance Rate Analysis**: Should be between 0.6-0.9 for good HMC performance
- **R-hat Diagnostics**: Should be < 1.1 for convergence
- **ESS Analysis**: Ensure sufficient effective sample size
- **Trace Plot Visualization**: Check for good mixing and convergence

### 7. **Current Assessment**

**HMC Status**: ✅ **LIKELY WORKING** but needs verification
- The parameter evolution patterns are consistent with active HMC sampling
- The convergence behavior suggests effective posterior exploration
- However, we lack direct evidence of HMC-specific diagnostics

**Next Steps**:
1. Run `v3hmc.py` to get complete HMC diagnostics
2. Analyze acceptance rates and convergence metrics
3. Generate and examine trace plots
4. Compare with EM-only results for performance differences

### 8. **Comparison with Previous Results**

The HMC run shows:
- **Similar Performance**: R² = 0.932 vs previous EM runs
- **Active Sampling**: More parameter dynamics than EM-only
- **Robust Uncertainty**: Mean uncertainty of 24.73 is reasonable
- **Feature Selection**: Clear evolution of lambda values indicating feature importance

## Conclusion

The HMC run appears to be working based on parameter evolution patterns, but we need the enhanced diagnostics from `v3hmc.py` to definitively confirm HMC performance and assess convergence quality. The current results suggest HMC is providing effective posterior exploration, but verification through proper diagnostics is essential.
