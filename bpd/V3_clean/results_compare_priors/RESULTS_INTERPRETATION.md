# Interpretation of Prior Comparison Results

This document summarizes and interprets the results from the prior comparison experiment, as found in `compare_priors_results.json`.

## Overview

Three different prior configurations were compared for the energy group in the Adaptive Prior ARD model:
- **AEH** (Adaptive Elastic Horseshoe)
- **Horseshoe**
- **ElasticNet**

The following metrics were evaluated for each prior:
- **R²**: Coefficient of determination (higher is better)
- **RMSE**: Root Mean Squared Error (lower is better)
- **MAE**: Mean Absolute Error (lower is better)
- **PICP90**: Prediction Interval Coverage Probability at 90% (closer to 0.9 is ideal)

## Results Table

| Prior       | R²    | RMSE   | MAE   | PICP90  |
|-------------|-------|--------|-------|---------|
| AEH         | 0.942 | 6.45   | 4.21  | 0.986   |
| Horseshoe   | 0.942 | 6.45   | 4.21  | 0.986   |
| ElasticNet  | 0.942 | 6.45   | 4.21  | 0.987   |

## Interpretation

- **Performance Similarity**: All three priors yield nearly identical results across all metrics. This suggests that, for this dataset and feature set, the choice of prior (among these three) does not significantly affect predictive performance or uncertainty calibration.
- **R²**: All models achieve a high R² (~0.942), indicating that the models explain a large proportion of the variance in the target variable.
- **RMSE & MAE**: Both error metrics are low and consistent across priors, further supporting the conclusion that model fit is robust to the choice of prior.
- **PICP90**: All models slightly over-cover the 90% prediction interval (values ~0.986–0.987), meaning the uncertainty estimates are slightly conservative but well-calibrated.

## Model Selection Implications

Given the near-identical performance, model selection can be based on other considerations such as:
- **Interpretability**: ElasticNet may be preferred for its simplicity and interpretability.
- **Sparsity**: Horseshoe and AEH priors are designed to encourage sparsity and may be more robust in settings with many irrelevant features.
- **Computational Efficiency**: If training time or convergence differs, this could be a deciding factor (not assessed here).

## Notes on Log Files

The log files (`aeh_hyperparams_log.txt`, `em_progress_log.txt`, `beta_tau_log.txt`) are empty for this run, so no additional diagnostic information is available from them.

## Conclusion

For this experiment, all three prior choices perform equivalently. The results suggest that the model is robust to the choice of prior for the energy group, at least for the current data and features. Further analysis could explore other datasets, more complex feature sets, or different prior hyperparameters to see if differences emerge.
