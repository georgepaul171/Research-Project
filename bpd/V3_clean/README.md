# Adaptive Prior Bayesian Regression: V3_clean

## Project Overview
This folder contains code, results, and diagnostics for experiments with custom Bayesian regression models using Adaptive Elastic Horseshoe (AEH) and hierarchical priors. The focus is on understanding the effect of these priors on model fit, uncertainty, and prediction range, compared to comprehensive baseline models with full statistical validation.

## Main Findings & Model Comparisons
- **AdaptivePriorARD with AEH prior** (on energy group) achieves **excellent performance** with R² = 0.942, RMSE = 6.45, and MAE = 4.21
- **AEH prior successfully adapts** its hyperparameters (τ, α, β, λ) during training for optimal regularization
- **Energy features** (ghg_emissions_int_log, electric_eui, fuel_eui, floor_area_log) use AEH prior with adaptive regularisation
- **Building and interaction features** use standard hierarchical priors for stability
- **Prediction range** is much improved (-21.25 to 152.70 vs true range 4.78-154.21) after fixing scaling issues
- **Model converges quickly** (3 iterations) with stable training dynamics
- **Comprehensive statistical validation** shows robust performance across multiple validation strategies

## Statistical Validation Results
- **Bootstrap validation**: R² = 0.942 [95% CI: 0.931, 0.950] - Very robust
- **Statistical significance**: 13/15 comparisons significant with large effect sizes
- **Out-of-sample validation**: R² = 0.932, RMSE = 6.97, MAE = 4.52
- **Sensitivity analysis**: Model stable across prior strengths (β₀ = 0.01-100.0)
- **Feature importance**: `fuel_eui` most critical (R² drop = 0.037 when removed)

## AEH Prior Implementation
- **Energy Group (4 features)**: Uses Adaptive Elastic Horseshoe prior
  - `ghg_emissions_int_log` (19.3% importance)
  - `electric_eui` (15.4% importance) 
  - `fuel_eui` (16.9% importance) - **Most critical feature**
  - `floor_area_log` (0.7% importance)
- **Building Group (4 features)**: Uses hierarchical prior
- **Interaction Group (4 features)**: Uses hierarchical prior

## AEH Hyperparameter Adaptation
- **τ (global shrinkage)**: 0.85 (increasing for stronger regularisation)
- **α (elastic net mixing)**: 0.41 (balanced L1/L2 regularisation)
- **β (horseshoe vs elastic net)**: 0.69 (reduced horseshoe influence)
- **λ (local shrinkage)**: Adapting per feature for optimal regularisation

## Comprehensive Research Analysis
The model now includes:
- **Statistical significance testing** (paired t-tests, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests)
- **Multiple baseline models** (RF, XGBoost, SVR, Neural Network)
- **Sensitivity analysis** (prior strength, features, data size)
- **Out-of-sample validation** (temporal, random, bootstrap)
- **Comprehensive visualisations** and statistical reports
