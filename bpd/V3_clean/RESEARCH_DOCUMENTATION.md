### 2.3 Model Architecture
**Adaptive Elastic Horseshoe (AEH) Prior:**
- **Prior Type**: Hierarchical adaptive elastic horseshoe
- **Inference**: EM algorithm
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Calibrated prediction intervals
- **Feature Groups**: Energy, Building, and Interaction features

### 2.4 Uncertainty Calibration Process

#### Initial Challenge
The model initially exhibited severely over-conservative uncertainty estimates:
- **Original PICP values**: All 1.0 (perfect coverage but useless intervals)
- **Mean uncertainty**: 121.19 (19x larger than RMSE)
- **Issue**: Prediction intervals were too wide to be practically useful

#### Calibration Journey
**Iteration 1**: Calibration factor = 20.0 (original)
- Result: Severely over-conservative (PICP = 1.0)

**Iteration 2**: Calibration factor = 1.0
- Result: Still over-conservative (PICP = 1.0)

**Iteration 3**: Calibration factor = 0.05
- Result: Significant improvement (PICP = 0.93-0.99)
- Mean uncertainty: 24.94 (4x RMSE)

**Iteration 4**: Calibration factor = 0.03
- Result: Minimal further improvement (PICP = 0.93-0.99)
- Mean uncertainty: 25.05 (4x RMSE)

#### Final Calibration Assessment
The calibration factor of 0.05 was selected as optimal, providing:
- Reasonable uncertainty estimates
- Slightly over-conservative but acceptable PICP values
- Balance between calibration accuracy and practical utility
