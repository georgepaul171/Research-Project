## Research Questions and Objectives

### Primary Research Questions
1. **How do different Bayesian prior specifications affect model performance in building energy prediction?**
2. **What is the trade-off between model regularization and predictive accuracy in energy performance modeling?**
3. **How can uncertainty quantification improve the reliability of building energy predictions?**
4. **Which feature selection methods provide the most interpretable and accurate energy models?**

### Research Objectives
- Compare the performance of Adaptive Elastic Horseshoe (AEH) priors against traditional Bayesian approaches
- Evaluate the impact of hierarchical priors on model interpretability and prediction accuracy
- Assess uncertainty calibration in Bayesian regression models for building energy data
- Develop guidelines for prior specification in energy performance modeling

## Experimental Design

### Study Design
This research employs a **comparative experimental design** with multiple model configurations:

1. **Baseline Models**: Linear Regression, Bayesian Ridge
2. **Advanced Bayesian Models**: Adaptive Prior ARD with different prior specifications
3. **Hierarchical Models**: Group-specific priors for different feature categories

### Model Configurations Tested

#### Baseline Models
- **Linear Regression**: Standard least squares regression
- **Bayesian Ridge**: Ridge regression with automatic relevance determination

#### Adaptive Prior Models
- **AEH Prior**: Adaptive Elastic Horseshoe with varying `beta_0` values (1.0, 10.0, 100.0)
- **Hierarchical Prior**: Group-specific priors for energy, building, and interaction features
- **Spike-Slab Prior**: Mixture of point mass and normal distribution

### Experimental Factors

#### Independent Variables
1. **Prior Type**: hierarchical, spike_slab, horseshoe, adaptive_elastic_horseshoe
2. **Prior Strength**: Controlled by `beta_0` parameter
3. **Feature Groups**: energy, building, interaction features
4. **Uncertainty Calibration**: With/without post-hoc calibration

#### Dependent Variables
1. **Predictive Accuracy**: RMSE, MAE, R²
2. **Uncertainty Quality**: Calibration error, interval coverage
3. **Model Interpretability**: Feature importance, sparsity
4. **Computational Efficiency**: Training time, convergence

## Statistical Framework

### Bayesian Framework
The research employs a hierarchical Bayesian framework:

```
y_i ~ Normal(μ_i, σ²)
μ_i = X_i^T β
β_j ~ Prior(θ_j)
θ_j ~ Hyperprior(φ)
```

### Prior Specifications

#### Adaptive Elastic Horseshoe (AEH)
```
β_j ~ Normal(0, τ²λ_j²)
λ_j ~ Half-Cauchy(0, 1)
τ ~ Half-Cauchy(0, τ_0)
τ_0 ~ Gamma(a, b)
```

#### Hierarchical Prior
```
β_j ~ Normal(0, σ_j²)
σ_j² ~ InverseGamma(α_j, β_j)
```

### Model Evaluation Criteria

#### Predictive Performance
- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: Overall prediction accuracy
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Robust measure of prediction error
- **Coefficient of Determination (R²)**: Proportion of variance explained

#### Uncertainty Quantification
- **Calibration Error**: Difference between nominal and empirical coverage
- **Interval Width**: Average width of prediction intervals
- **Coverage Probability**: Proportion of true values within intervals

#### Model Interpretability
- **Feature Importance**: Standardized coefficient magnitudes
- **Sparsity**: Number of effectively zero coefficients
- **SHAP Values**: Local and global feature contributions

## Validation Strategy
