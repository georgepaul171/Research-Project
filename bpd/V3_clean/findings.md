## 5. Feature Importance (Standard & SHAP)

- **Standard Feature Importance (AEH model):**
  - Top: `ghg_emissions_int_log` (19.3%), `ghg_per_area` (19.4%), `energy_intensity_ratio` (18.9%), `electric_eui` (15.4%), `fuel_eui` (16.9%)
- **SHAP Importance (AEH model):**
  - Top: `ghg_per_area` (9.02), `energy_intensity_ratio` (8.94), `ghg_emissions_int_log` (8.15), `electric_eui` (6.58), `fuel_eui` (7.97)
- **Sensitivity Analysis Importance:**
  - Most critical: `fuel_eui` (R² drop = 0.037)
  - Second: `electric_eui` (R² drop = 0.017)
  - Third: `ghg_emissions_int_log` (R² drop = 0.018)

**Energy features dominate importance**, which is expected given their high correlation with the target (site_eui).
